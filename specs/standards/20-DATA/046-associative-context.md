# Standard 046: Associative Context Windowing
**Status:** Active | **Category:** DATA

## The Rule
1. **The 70/30 Split:** When assembling context, allocate 70% of the character budget to Direct Matches (Keyword/Vector) and 30% to Associative Matches (Shared Tags).
2. **Tag Harvesting:** Extract semantic tags from the Direct Matches to find "Neighboring" memories.
3. **Unified Stream:** Present both Direct and Associative snippets in the same output stream, clearly labeled.
