well Dory specifically wants me to so that way the proposal is what she wants it to be lol. 
Jade being like her sister. Jade is expecting me to do so to be honest. I have been putting it off. Dory in our discord has put in specific things but I think that the music box with Helena is the best - with the ring she wants but Jade would be best to help me choose it - damn I hope we didnt lose that context ! you and I spent a whole day talking through possible proposal places like the light temple in las vegas nm and the cathedral steps in Santa Fe. Anyway I feel this way about Jade yes but Dory and her are still like sisters and I want Jade to film the proposal 


here is the context from instagram

Hey rob I have a question! At work I am tasked with making some pre rolls. Do you know a good way to combine terpenes with the shake? We  have watermelon and mango and are apparently supposed to dilute them. I’m not sure in what or how much to use
You sent
Are your terpenes in a solvent?
You sent
If the terpenes are in a solvent like alcohol that wouldn't do. If they are Like a syrup you could determine the ml of liquid per ounce and calculate
You sent
You may have to smoke a bit to taste it. But in nature terpenes make up less than 1% of cannabis and are very potent
You sent
If you use a dilutant. What is it?

You sent
Happy to help!

Cannabis is my main squeeze

4177Agreed! Hope your week is going well It was such a fun trip!! We all need to do more trips together ✨I hope you don't mind me saying. I had a great time hanging out with you over the weekend and really really appreciate you feeling comfortable to share you feelings and memories of childhood. It takes alot to open up and I respect that. Also I am sorry if I pushed you around much during the concert I just wanted to keep people from running you and Dory over but if it was too much then I apologize. I was thinking about it after I got some rest today. Anyways cheers looking forward to future trips! Let us know you make it home safe! Thanks for everything. Coming At ga + 3:52344Back at ga+244We are in the middle between purple and pink stage Found a good spot to sit if you can find me 2:38 
Please add timestamps to your texts. 
I am near the front of the purple stage but more to the left sideFound ga+ where you atWhere are the ga+ lockersYeahCan I put my crocs with you giys Lockers are sold out 87035Ok I'll call you right back.Thank you again! Okay! 👌Jadukem@sandia.govYes! Send it to my work email Thank you! I'm trying! Really appreciate it. Can I email it to you? I'll see what I can do :)Yeah no problem Rob!! Loved “Hey Jade hope all is well I wanted to ask that if …”Hey Jade hope all is well I wanted to ask that if anyone around you mentions they need a person for a software position I am putting in apps each day now and perhaps you'd be able to verbally get me in line. I could send you my resume if you think it's something you wouldn't mind doing? I know it's alot to ask so don't feel bad if you don't think you can. I know you work alot and late right? I'm sorry to hear that! I totally understand. Sometimes we have to reevaluate our lives and the people in them. I am sure if things were getting lopsided in the relationship you're probably feeling overall like a weight has been taken off. That's gotta be a relief 

. Oh maybe we should all go out to dinner sometime! Next month.. Money is a bit tight at the moment unfortunately waiting to get paid to start getting caught up. But it would be nice to hang out maybe! I'm okay! Just have to process the grief of an ended relationship. I think I was ready for this to be over. I put in a lot of effort and he was giving noting at the end. Sorry if bringing it up is a buzz kill just wanted to check in since here we areYou doing alright? I know you and Eli recently broke up! I hope it's been easier on you. Long distance relationship are always always hard. Yeah the Helena church would be siiiickAnd her preferred locations. Very important 😂That's okay! I remember you mentioning a proposal a while back! This all came up organically so I thought I would send everything to you before I forgot 💀Hey, thanks for the links! Making it easy on me lol. Dory does tell me alot of this stuff but I am happy to refer to you for the things I don't know 🙂I'm a bit of a space cadet sometimes https://edengardenjewelry.com/en-us/products/colour-changing-alexandrite-engagement-ring-yellow-gold-proposal-ring-with-diamondsThis is Jade
