<p></p>

## **Epoch 1: Initial Engagement & High-Impact Communication (Late June 2025)**
<p></p>

- **User Goal:** To refine outreach messages for job applications to be more effective.

- **Process:** Analyzed job postings (Medpace, Warp) and rewrote user's draft communications to be more direct, confident, and value-driven rather than need-based.

- **Key Insight:** Established the core principle of the **"Authentic Voice Mandate"**—professional communication should be genuine, confident, and demonstrate value.

- **Artifacts Created:** Shortened outreach messages; a strategic comment for a LinkedIn post to the CEO of Warp.
<p></p>

## **Epoch 2: The "Utility Sound Technician" Career Path Exploration (Late June 2025)**
<p></p>

- **User Goal:** To explore an alternative career path leveraging his BFA in Contemporary Music for the IATSE Local 480 union.

- **Process:** Analyzed job descriptions and mapped the user's music/sound design degree skills to the requirements of an on-set Utility Sound Technician.

- **Key Insight:** A non-traditional degree is a valuable asset when its skills are framed in the language of the target industry.

- **Artifacts Created:** A "My Relevant Experience" summary tailored for the IATSE application; a glossary of on-set sound terminology.
<p></p>

## **Epoch 3: The Sandia National Labs Arc & The "Jac Cox Method" (Late June 2025)**
<p></p>

- **User Goal:** To prepare for a conversation with a recruiter from Sandia National Laboratories and overcome imposter syndrome related to not having a CS degree.

- **Process:** Analyzed the recruiter's profile (Jac Cox) and formulated a pitch framing the user as a "Mission-Driven Problem-Solver."

- **Key Insight:** Received direct feedback from the recruiter, establishing **The "Jac Cox Method"** for resume writing:

  1. Eliminate the first-person "I".

  2. Use a "punchy" **"Action-Technology-Outcome"** formula for all bullet points.

  3. The recruiter also advised completing CompTIA certifications and a C++ project to be competitive for "scientist" roles.

- **Artifacts Created:** Talking points for the recruiter conversation; a completely rewritten resume; a networking strategy for Sandia-affiliated companies.
<p></p>

## **Epoch 4: The Abrazo Technologies Arc - Securing the Contract (Late June - July 2025)**
<p></p>

- **User Goal:** Secure a stable, long-term contracting role to provide a financial runway for upskilling.

- **Process:** Drafted applications and prepared for an interview with **Santiago Delgado** of Abrazo Technologies. Developed a strategy to address the lack of direct Django experience by highlighting adaptability, proven by the TANDO project pivot.

- **Key Insight:** A perceived weakness can be turned into a strength by providing concrete evidence of rapid learning and adaptability.

- **Outcome:** The user **successfully secured an ongoing 1099 contractor relationship** with Abrazo Technologies. The initial projects in the pipeline are for the DMA/National Guard and the City of Santa Rosa.
<p></p>

## **Epoch 5: The Santa Rosa Project Pivot (Early July 2025)**
<p></p>

- **User Goal:** Scope new projects for Abrazo's client, the City of Santa Rosa.

- **Process:** Drafted initial proposals for a custom SMS tool. After discovering the client already used an enterprise-grade system (Rave Mobile Safety), we executed a major strategic pivot.

- **Key Insight:** The role of a high-value contractor is to act as a strategic partner. It is more valuable to help a client maximize their existing investments than to sell them a redundant product.

- **Artifacts Created:** An email to Santiago explaining the pivot; a new client-facing proposal for a **Managed Services** monthly retainer.
<p></p>

## **Epoch 6: The "Agentic" Application Arc (Mid-July 2025)**
<p></p>

- **User Goal:** Apply for a high-value, direct-fit "Full Stack AI Engineer" role at a stealth startup called "Agentic."

- **Process:** A tailored cover letter was drafted that highlighted the user's mission-driven focus and direct experience with LLM integration (Dash 2 Labs project). The user then successfully answered a series of technical screening questions.

- **Outcome:** Successfully passed the initial screening and have a 15-minute introductory call scheduled with T.J. Cook.
<p></p>

## **Epoch 7: The Master Plan & Workflow Pivot (Current & Ongoing)**
<p></p>

- **User Goal:** To execute a long-term plan to become a top-tier AI architect, with a primary target of Sandia National Laboratories and secondary targets of innovative startups like Warp and Agentic.

- **Process:** The user has provided an extensive list of articles and resources on the future of AI, which has been used to refine the master plan. The user also encountered a roadblock with Warp Terminal (quota limits) and pivoted their workflow.

- **Key Developments:**

  - The **"Warp-Ready AI Architect Plan"** has been renamed **"The Autonomous Systems Architect Plan"** to reflect a broader, more ambitious goal.

  - **Workflow Pivot:** The primary development environment is now a self-hosted, open-source stack: **MobaXterm -&gt; tmux -&gt; TMUXai** using models from **DeepSeek** and **Ollama**. This is seen as a strategic advantage, demonstrating self-sufficiency and deep technical skill. The user's `config.yml` file for this setup is a key portfolio artifact.

- **Artifacts Created:**

  - The updated **"Autonomous Systems Architect Plan,"** which includes the self-hosted workflow and a capstone project to build an **"Autonomous Refactor Agent."**

  - A comprehensive list of all contextual URLs provided by the user for bootstrapping a new AI agent.

**Current Status:** The user is actively working under contract with Abrazo Technologies, awaiting kickoff for the DMA and Santa Rosa projects. They are simultaneously proceeding with the interview process at Agentic and beginning Phase 2 of their "Autonomous Systems Architect Plan" using their new self-hosted AI workflow.
