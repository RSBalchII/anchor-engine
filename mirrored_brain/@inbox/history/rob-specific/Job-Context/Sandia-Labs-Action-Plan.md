This is an absolutely fantastic debrief. That conversation with Jac was a huge success. You didn't just have a good chat; you received a specific, actionable roadmap on exactly how to get hired at Sandia. This is a gift.

Let's internalize his advice and build a new, comprehensive plan. He told you precisely what he wants to see, and now we will execute it.

### The "Sandia-Ready" Career Plan

This plan has three parallel tracks that will run over the next year: **Networking**, **Resume Rebuilding**, and **Upskilling & Projects**.

---
#### **Track 1: Strategic Networking**

**Objective:** Build relationships with recruiters at key Sandia-affiliated companies to create multiple pathways into the Sandia ecosystem.

* **Target Companies:** Cloverleaf llc, Rhino Core llc, Encantado, Blue Halo.
* **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Identify Recruiters:** Use LinkedIn to find Technical Recruiters or Talent Acquisition specialists at each of the four target companies. Contact Karla Mondragon for a similar conversation as was had with Jac.
    2.  **Send a Connection Request:** Send a personalized connection request.
    3.  **Draft Your Outreach Message:** Once they accept, send a brief, professional message. Here is a template:

    > "Hi [Recruiter Name], my name is Robert Balch. I'm a full-stack developer and data scientist based here in Albuquerque. I'm strategically focusing my career on contributing to the mission at Sandia National Labs, and I know [Their Company Name] is a key partner in that ecosystem. I wanted to connect and introduce myself. My expertise is in Python, JavaScript, and building data-driven applications. I'd be grateful for the opportunity to stay on your radar for any future roles that might align with my skills."

#### **Track 2: The Resume Rebuild (The "Jac Cox" Method)**

**Objective:** Transform your resume from a list of tasks into a high-impact document that is "punchy" and results-oriented, using the specific feedback Jac provided.

**Core Principle:** Eliminate the first-person "I". Frame every bullet point to answer three questions:
1.  **What did you do?** (The action)
2.  **What did you use?** (The technology)
3.  **What was the outcome?** (The result or impact)

**Action Plan: Resume Bullet Point Transformation**

Let's take an example from your current resume and rebuild it using this method:

* **Your Old Bullet Point:** "Re-architected a flawed data structure for the Fellow Directory by adding a 'Last Name' custom field with ACF, performing data entry, and modifying the theme's PHP template to enable correct alphabetical sorting."

* **The New "Jac Cox" Version:**
    * **Action:** "Enabled correct alphabetical sorting for a public-facing Fellow Directory..."
    * **Technology:** "...by re-architecting the data structure, adding custom fields with ACF, and modifying PHP templates."
    * **Outcome:** "...resulting in improved data integrity and a more professional user experience."

* **Let's try another:**
    * **Old:** "Orchestrated and implemented natural language-driven data visualization for the chatbot on the SpaceValley website, integrating LIDA with a Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM using Langchain and Langgraph."
    * **New:** "Developed a natural language-driven data visualization feature using Python, LangChain, and a Gemini LLM, allowing non-technical users to generate complex graphs from simple text queries."

We will go through your entire resume and apply this "Action-Technology-Outcome" formula to every single bullet point.

#### **Track 3: Upskilling & Project Execution**

**Objective:** Fulfill Jac's direct advice to demonstrate your capabilities as a "scientist" through certifications and tangible project work.

* **Action Plan 1: Complete Your CompTIA Certifications.** Jac explicitly told you to keep working on these. This is now a top priority. It shows you have the foundational knowledge required to work in a high-security, high-reliability environment like Sandia.
* **Action Plan 2: Execute "The Autonomous Refactor Agent" Project.** This capstone project is now more important than ever. It's not just a portfolio piece; it's a direct response to Jac's request to see completed projects on your GitHub. It will showcase the high-level architectural thinking that separates a "developer" from a "scientist" or "engineer" in his eyes.

You have a clear path forward. Jac told you exactly what to do. Your goal for the next year is to execute this plan meticulously. Every step you take should be with the intention of having a new, powerful update for him the next time you connect. This is how you get the job.
