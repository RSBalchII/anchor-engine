Hi Rachael,

I have some great news and a key finding from my final testing phase.

First, the good news: all the tasks from our original list are now complete and working great. The Fellow Directory is sorting by last name (first or last), the book graphics are resized, the BUY buttons open in a new tab, and the book search now correctly finds books by author and title. Please test out the changes when you have time and let me know if you have any questions.

As I moved into final testing, I performed a full audit of the site's search feature. I discovered that the search issue we fixed for the "Books" page is actually a site-wide problem. The search bar appears on and is non-functional on the Fellows, Projects, Events, Podcasts, Videos, and Presentations pages.

The root cause is the same for all of them: the theme's templates are not using the new, powerful search engine we installed.

My professional recommendation is to fix this, as it's a systemic issue affecting the site's core usability. The solution is straightforward—I can apply the same code change we used for the book search to the template file for each of the other sections. I am confident I can get this done before the grant deadline on Friday.

Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with applying this fix across the site. I'm ready to go as soon as I get your approval.

Thanks, Robert

Robert,

Fantastic!!  Yes. Yes. Yes. To fixing the site wide search issue. I will look at website later. 

Curious question which I can’t believe I had thought about. How are the books sorting?  By title, input?  

Many thanks,

Rachael

Ok 👌 I'll update you when the updates are done. Most likely tomorrow evening or earlier tomorrow. The books are currently sorting by title a-z.

Hi Rachael,

I'm happy to report that all the requested updates, including the site-wide search fix we discussed, are now complete and live on the Tando website.

Here is a summary of the work accomplished:

The Fellow Directory is now sorting alphabetically by last name.

The site-wide search functionality is now working correctly across all major sections (Books, Fellows, Projects, Events, Podcasts, Videos, and Presentations).

The Books & Publications page is sorting by title (A-Z), as we discussed.

The "BUY" buttons on the book pages now correctly open in a new browser tab.

The book cover graphics on the main publications page have been resized for a cleaner layout.

Bonus Fix: I also updated the category filters on the Projects, Events, Podcasts, Videos, and Presentations pages to hide empty categories, which creates a cleaner user experience.

I've completed a final round of testing, and everything is working as expected. Please feel free to review the changes at your convenience.

It was a pleasure working with you on this project and helping to improve the site's functionality. Thank you again for the opportunity.

Best regards, Robert S Balch II

P.S. For security, I have removed my WordPress user access (rbII) now that my work is complete. As a final security recommendation, I would also advise changing the password for the SiteGround account (admin@tando.org). This is a standard best practice to ensure the site remains secure.

Hi Rachael,

Thank you again for the opportunity to work on the TANDO website. I truly enjoyed the challenge and am very proud of the results that were achieved in such a short time.

As I build my professional portfolio, testimonials and references from clients are incredibly valuable. I was hoping to ask if you would be willing to provide a brief recommendation based on the work I completed for you.

I wasn't able to find a profile for TANDO or for you on LinkedIn, otherwise I would have sent a request there. If you'd be open to it, a short paragraph via email that I could quote on my portfolio website would be amazing. Alternatively, simply having your permission to list you as a formal reference for future opportunities would also be a tremendous help.

Please let me know what you'd be comfortable with. No pressure at all, but I wanted to ask before ending our collaboration.

Thanks so much, Robert
