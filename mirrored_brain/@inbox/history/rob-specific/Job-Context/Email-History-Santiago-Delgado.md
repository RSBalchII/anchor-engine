Dear ABRAZO Technologies Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Full-Stack Developer contract position. I was informed about the position by Esteban Martinez and wanted to get a hold of you. I have over three years of experience developing containerized web applications, I am confident that I have the skills and mindset necessary to successfully support and enhance your system.

My professional experience has been centered on the exact technologies you use. I have a proven track record of developing applications with React for the frontend and creating robust Python-based REST APIs for the backend. My work consistently involves a deep understanding of PostgreSQL, from designing schemas to writing efficient queries. Furthermore, I am proficient with Git and GitHub for version control in collaborative team settings.

In response to your specific request for a summary of my Docker experience, I have utilized Docker and Docker Compose to containerize full-stack applications, managing separate services for React, Next., Adonis, Express, Flask, and PostgreSQL. This includes writing docker-compose.yml files, building custom images with Dockerfiles, and deploying these applications on Linux-based systems to ensure consistent and reproducible environments from development through to production. My work on "The PRRC Inventory Application" is a prime example of this workflow. I had a postgreSQL database container, an Adonis.js container for api and logic management, and a Next.js container for the frontend. 

I am a reliable, self-motivated developer who excels at problem-solving and clear communication. My resume is attached for your review, and my GitHub profile can be found here Github

I am available to start immediately and can accommodate a flexible work schedule to meet the team's needs. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Robert Balch II (505) 469-3786
