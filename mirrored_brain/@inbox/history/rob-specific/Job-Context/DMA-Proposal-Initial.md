Of course. This is a perfect opportunity to demonstrate your value by quickly diagnosing a client's needs and proposing a clear, actionable solution. The key is to structure this as a professional scope of work that justifies your hourly rate and timeline.

This requires two documents:
1.  A direct email to Santiago explaining the opportunity and your fee structure.
2.  A formal, client-facing proposal that Santiago can brand as Abrazo Technologies and present to the DMA / National Guard.

Let's structure the pricing. Your fee is **$90/hour**. A standard prime contractor rate would add a margin, so we'll propose a client-facing rate of **$120/hour**. For a 4-week (160-hour) project, this presents a clear budget.

* **Your Contracting Fee:** $90/hour (Total: $14,400)
* **Abrazo Tech's Price to the DMA:** $120/hour (Total: up to $19,200)

Here are the documents to make this happen.

### **1. Email to Santiago Delgado (Abrazo Technologies)**

**Subject:** Proposal for DMA / National Guard Website Support Project

**Hi Santiago,**

Following up on our discussion about the Department of Military Affairs project. I've consolidated their needs into a formal proposal that addresses their immediate bug fixes and the new feature request for the student application portal.

The attached proposal is client-facing and ready for you to brand as Abrazo. It outlines a scope of work to be completed over 2 to 4 weeks.

I've structured the investment as an hourly contract. The proposed rate to the client is **$120/hour**, with a maximum cap of 160 hours for a total project investment not to exceed $19,200. My contracting fee to you for this work would be **$90/hour**.

This approach provides the client with budget certainty while giving us the flexibility to address the issues thoroughly. Please take a look at the attached proposal and let me know your thoughts.

Best,

Robert

**PROJECT PROPOSAL**
**Website Support & Feature Development for the DMA National Guard Portal**

**Prepared For:** Department of Military Affairs (DMA)
**Prepared By:** Abrazo Technologies
**Date:** July 3, 2025

**1. Executive Summary**
The DMA National Guard recruitment website is a critical tool for engaging and processing new applicants. To ensure its optimal performance and enhance the applicant experience, Abrazo Technologies proposes a focused engagement to address two high-priority bugs and develop a new Applicant Status feature. This proposal outlines a scope of work to resolve existing issues with the administrative login and annual reporting tools, and to build a new dashboard that provides applicants with real-time status updates on their forms and overall application.

**2. Project Understanding & Goals**
We understand the immediate needs are to restore full functionality for administrative staff and to improve the clarity of the application process for new recruits. The project goals are:
* **Restore Admin Access:** Immediately resolve the login issue preventing administrative access.
* **Ensure Data Usability:** Correct the formatting bug in the annual reporting software to make data exports usable.
* **Enhance Applicant Experience:** Provide students with a clear, transparent view of their application status to reduce uncertainty and improve completion rates.

**3. Proposed Scope of Work**
This project will be executed in two parts: immediate bug fixes followed by new feature development.

**Part 1: Critical Bug Fixes (Estimated Completion: Week 1)**
* **Deliverable 1: Admin Login Functionality Repair**
    * Diagnose the root cause of the authentication failure for specific admin users.
    * Implement and test a robust code fix to restore reliable login access.
    * Verify the solution across multiple administrative accounts.
* **Deliverable 2: Annual Reporting Format Correction**
    * Analyze the software's output to identify the source of the formatting error.
    * Correct the relevant CSS or template files to ensure the report output is clean, properly formatted, and usable.
    * Validate the fix with a test generation of the annual report.

**Part 2: New Feature Development (Estimated Completion: Weeks 2-4)**
* **Deliverable 3: Student Application Status Module**
    * **Backend Development:** Develop the logic to track the submission status of each form associated with a student's application.
    * **Frontend Development:** Design and build the user interface components within the student portal, including:
        * A clear overall status message (e.g., "Under Review," "Action Required").
        * A checklist of all required forms, each marked with a visual indicator (e.g., a green check for complete, a red 'X' for incomplete).
        * A summary message indicating what actions are still needed (e.g., "3 forms require submittal").
    * **Integration:** Connect the frontend components to the backend logic to display real-time, accurate status information for each applicant.

**4. Investment Summary**
This project will be billed on an hourly basis, providing flexibility while ensuring dedicated resources for a swift resolution.

* **Hourly Rate:** $120/hour
* **Estimated Duration:** 80-160 hours (2-4 full-time weeks)
* **Total Investment:** The total project investment will not exceed **$19,200**. Invoices will be submitted weekly with detailed time logs.

**5. Next Steps**
To proceed with this project, please sign and return this proposal. Upon receipt, we will schedule an official project kickoff meeting and begin work on the critical bug fixes immediately.
