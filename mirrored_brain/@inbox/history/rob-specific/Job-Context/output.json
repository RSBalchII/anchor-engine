As part of my duties, I also may develop and maintain\nclose working relationships with Abrazo's clients.\nAbrazo's business involves providing IT services to its existing and prospective\ncustomers. Abrazo, its employees, and contractors may often have access to confidential\ninformation about Abrazo's clients' business. Abrazo's technology, processes, and client base\nare valuable and unique assets of Abrazo's business. I understand that Abrazo views its list of\nclients, including clients it will add in the course of our work together and its prospective clients\nthat it has begun marketing to, as confidential information that should not be disclosed to\npersons outside Abrazo's organization or be used by me for my own or anyone else's benefit,\nother than Abrazo.\nAbrazo's business would be seriously harmed by the unauthorized disclosure of its confidential\ninformation, its clients' confidential information, or the unauthorized use of any such\ninformation. Abrazo would be similarly harmed if I solicit its clients, prospective clients and\nemployees. The monetary harm of any of these things occurring may be difficult, if not\nimpossible, to measure.\nTherefore, in consideration for my continued opportunity to work as a contractor for Abrazo,\nAbrazo and I agree, as follows:\nAgreement To Maintain Confidential Information\n1. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any information not generally known by third parties,\nincluding Abrazo's competitors or the general public, whether or not expressly identified\nas confidential. \u201cConfidential information\u201d includes information about Abrazo's software,\nsoftware source codes (including software and source codes for products in\ndevelopment), trade secrets, proprietary technology, marketing information, sales\ninformation, training materials, data processing, internet or intranet services, strategic\nplans, compensation, and finances.

This includes all\ninformation or types of information that I know or have reason to know that Abrazo or its\nclients intend to keep confidential.\n3. If either Abrazo or I terminate my employment as a contractor, I will deliver to Abrazo\nwithin 24 hours all of Abrazo's property, including computers, cell phones, technology,\noriginals and copies regardless of form (such paper, computer or electronic).

I agree that all copyrights, patents, patentable material, trade secrets, trademarks or\nother intellectual property rights associated with any ideas, concepts, techniques,\ninventions, processes, or works of authorship developed or created by me during the\ncourse of performing work for or on behalf of Abrazo (collectively, the \u201cWork Product\u201d)\nwill belong exclusively to Abrazo and will, to the extent possible, be considered a \u201cwork\nmade for hire\u201d as that term is defined in Title 17 of the United States Code.
