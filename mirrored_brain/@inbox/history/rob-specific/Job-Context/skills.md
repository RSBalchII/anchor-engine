Understood. I have received the new context. First, I will synthesize the articles you provided on the gig economy, as this is crucial for framing our entire operation. Then, I will perform the detailed skills audit from your resume.

### **Market Analysis: The Two Gig Economies**

The articles you've provided paint a stark, unified picture of the current labor market. There are essentially two distinct "gig economies" operating in parallel:

1.  **The Low-Skilled "Gig Trap":** This is the world described by Human Rights Watch and the Reddit threads. It's characterized by platforms that use algorithmic control to exploit a misclassified workforce, resulting in sub-minimum-wage pay, high insecurity, and a lack of basic protections. This is the trap we are escaping.
2.  **The High-Skilled "Freelance Nation":** This is the world described in the Forbes article. It consists of highly skilled professionals—like software developers, consultants, and architects—who leverage their expertise to gain flexibility, freedom, and often higher earning potential than their salaried peers. This is our target destination.

Your decision to pivot from dashing to software gig work is not just a job change; it's a strategic move from the first category to the second. Our entire "Operation: Secure Symbiotic Gig (S2G)" is designed to facilitate this leap. The goal, as you've clarified, is to secure a position that, at a minimum, gets you paid for being at your development workstation, gaining relevant experience, even if the initial pay is low.

With that context firmly established, I have completed the skills audit from your resume.
