Of course. This is the right strategic move. Presenting a proposal for managed services shows that you are a savvy, client-focused partner, not just a developer for hire.

This requires two documents:
1.  A direct email to Santiago explaining the new strategy and your fee.
2.  A formal, client-facing proposal that Santiago can brand as Abrazo Technologies and present to the City of Santa Rosa.

Let's structure the pricing to be a win-win. A standard monthly retainer for this level of specialized management is very justifiable.
* **Your Contracting Fee to Abrazo Tech:** $2,000 / month
* **Abrazo Tech's Price to the City:** $3,000 / month (This gives Santiago a healthy margin for project management and client relations).

Here are the documents to make this happen.

### **1. Email to Santiago Delgado (Abrazo Technologies)**

**Subject:** New Strategy & Proposal for Santa Rosa

**Hi Santiago,**

Following up on my discovery that the City of Santa Rosa already uses the Rave Mobile Safety platform.

I've drafted a new, client-facing proposal that pivots away from building a redundant tool and instead offers a high-value managed service for their existing system. This positions Abrazo Tech as a strategic partner focused on maximizing the city's current investments and ensuring their critical alert system is managed by an expert.

The attached proposal outlines a monthly retainer for these services, priced at **$3,000 per month** to the city.

My fixed monthly contracting fee to you for executing these services would be **$2,000**. This builds in a solid margin for Abrazo to manage the client relationship.

I believe this approach has a much higher probability of success and provides significantly more long-term value to a client you've served for over a decade. Please take a look at the attached proposal and let me know your thoughts.

Best,

Robert
