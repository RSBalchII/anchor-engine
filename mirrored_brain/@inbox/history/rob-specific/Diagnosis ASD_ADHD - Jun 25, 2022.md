**NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION REPORT (CONFIDENTIAL** \- DO **NOT** COPY **WITHOUT PERMISSION)** 

**NAME**: Robert Balch 

**DATE OF** BIRTH: 11/07/1992 

**REFERRING PROVIDER:** Dennis Abernathy, LPCC & Jeanine Cordoba, PhD, Life Healing Center **DATE(S) OF INTERVIEW/TESTING:** 06/02/2022; 06/07/2022 

**DATE OF REPORT**: 06/25/2022 

**REASON FOR REFERRAL:** 

Robert Balch is a 29\-year\-old man referred for evaluation because of questions about whether he has attentional or other cognitive problems or is on the autism spectrum. Evaluation is medically necessary to inform treatment, 

Sources of Information: 

Interview of Robert Balch, Darlene Santos Balch Chavez (mother), and Dorinda "Dorry" Abeyta (life partner); review of available records. The background information contained in this report was obtained from the interviews conducted and has not been independently verified. 

**CURRENT STATUS**: 

Mr. Balch lives in downtown Albuquerque with his girlfriend, Dorry. He is not working currently. He worked in January and is getting ready to go back to school in August. He spends his time playing video games and hanging out. He likes to ride his bike but hasn't gone out because the air quality has been very bad due to fires. He is also a professional cannabis grower who works with a group of friends. Their first harvest will be soon, and he hopes to sell their product. He is hoping to develop growing cannabis into a small business. 

Mr. Balch is not employed currently. He has worked at two cannabis dispensaries. He quit one job selling cannabis because he was not given a promised raise after a year. The other situation he first sold and then they put him into growing cannabis where he felt disrespected, so he quit. He also worked a janitorial job and worked in the café at the Veteran's Hospital. He ended up losing both jobs because he didn't fit in. His mother has also noticed that his problems with focus and "misunderstandings" have led to him losing jobs. 

There are foods where he finds the textures offensive; for example, he doesn't like mayonnaise or yogurt, and did not eat cheese for years. He developed an eating disorder where he would restrict certain foods based on what he read on the internet or what people told him or on calories or ingredients. He acknowledged that he "gets stuck on something", other than his obsessions about food, for periods of time. For example, he has been obsessed with Rome and Viking history since childhood. He has a variety of video games that are history\-focused, and particularly on Roman times. 

Dorry has noticed that there was an anxiety component that drove his eating disorder, where he became obsessed with his diet or food intake to the point that he became very rigid and eventually upset or sick. She also mentioned that he has more structured behavior and a "masking laugh" when in public which is different than how he is at home. He admitted often feeling insecure about how he is perceived in social settings because sometimes "people are talking in a language \[he\] doesn't understand". 

600 Central Avenue SE, Suite 221, Albuquerque, NM 87102 | (505)345-9288 | Fax (505)212-0359 info@riograndeclinic.com | www.jryan@cybermesa.com   
He completed a Bachelor of Arts in Contemporary Music from Santa Fe University of Art and Design (SFUAD) in 2016\. He was paying for school on his own and had some veterans' benefits and managed to finish shortly before the school closed. He has some student loans that are not in repayment currently. He is looking at pursing a Master of Science in Anthropology, driven by his intense interest in history, with a minor in Economics as a second area of study, at University of New Mexico. Because the school is very competitive, he is going to take some introductory courses in Anthropology at Central New Mexico Community College in the fall to prepare. He is also considering volunteering at dig sites to get experience. 

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION:**   
His mother is from Guam and his father is of Norwegian descent. Mr. Balch was born in Socorro, NM, which was a small town when he was growing up. His father is a professor at New Mexico Technical University and is a geologist working on oil\-related projects. Mr. Balch commented that his father is "really smart" but hard to talk to and with poor social skills, which his mother confirmed. 

His mother said he was her first full\-term pregnancy, but she had a hard time with the birth. When he finally delivered, he was not breathing but quickly revived. By the next day, he was allowed to go home. His mother noted that he was a smart baby and responded well to his environment. They had a second boy two years later, Alex, who had severe autism which overshadowed Mr. Balch's development. 

Mr. Balch's parents divorced when he was eight years old, and his mother moved to California. So, he lived with his father during the school year and visited his mother over the summer and some vacations. It was a difficult time, and his mother was very sad about not having the children with her full\-time. Then she moved back and lived very near his father, so custody was shared. He also had a stepmother and his mother had different partners before she settled down with a permanent one. 

When Mr. Balch was about ten years old, things settled down and Ms. Chavez said that she started to notice he had trouble focusing on "almost anything" except reading and computers and was a "different kind of kid". He would also stay up for days at a time because of stomach pain which he thinks was due to stress. His mother said he has always "been a rebel" and very independent and got into some trouble at school because he did not follow some of the rules (i.e., skateboarding on school grounds). 

He was bullied starting in elementary school because he was "different" and seen as Asian and was called derogatory names. Being singled out got worse as he went through school and led to him avoiding his peers. His grades went down after his parents divorced because he "quit caring". He decided that passing was good enough, so he didn't always pay attention in class and was sometimes secretly reading a book instead of listening. In high school, he started missing a class and then he'd miss the whole day, which got worse by his senior year. When he was 17, during his senior year he ran away from his father's house after they got into a fistfight over the way his stepmother treated him. He stayed with friends and managed to finish his semester over the summer, so he got his high school degree. 

Medical History: 

He has always had problems sleeping and sleepwalks now. 

Mental Health History:   
He did some binge drinking in high school to the point of blacking out but quit drinking heavily five years ago. Now, he might have a beer 2-3 times a week and never drinks enough to have a hang\-over in the morning 

When his eating disorder was active, he tried a variety of diets. He only ate protein powder for three months (and got sick), fasted (and intermittently binged on sugar and chips), and tried the Keto diet. He also counted calories and read labels obsessively which drove his food restriction. He dieted to the point   
he was down to 120 lbs. He is now at 150 lbs. which is a healthy weight and now he eats what he likes and enjoys food. 

Health Status: 

**Medical conditions:** severe allergies with asthmatic response   
**Mental health conditions**: depression and anxiety; hx eating disorder w/food restriction; obsessive behavior 

**Smoking:** does not smoke 

**Vision**: he has very poor vision which is corrected with contacts 

**NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING**: 

Informed consent was obtained, HIPAA policy was provided, a clinical interview was conducted, and the following measures were administered according to standardized practices:

**Behavioral Observations:** 

Mr. Balch presented as a healthy\-looking man with a medium build and long brown hair. He is within an acceptable weight for his height. There were no problems with balance or gait, or fine motor skills or hearing. He was wearing his contacts and vision was adequate for testing. Speech was fluent but vocal tone lacked inflection or changes in volume and there was no gesturing for emphasis. Eye gaze was down or staring. He was open in response to questions and not unfriendly, but his affect was fairly flat. There was not much back and forth conversation; rather he responded to the question, sometimes including quite a bit of detail, and then he stopped talking. He mentioned being nervous about testing although there were no overt indications. He was interested in testing and questioned why different tests were being given. In order to keep the process moving, those questions were deferred until the feedback session. 

**Test Results:** 

Orientation: 

Oriented to name, age, place, city, month, day, year, time of day, day of the week and current president 

Intellectual Function: 

**Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\-**IV: is the most widely used measure of intellectual functioning. The WAIS\-IV is comprised of four index scales: Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory and Processing Speed. Typically, 10 subtests combine to comprise a Full Scale IQ (FSIQ). Verbal Comprehension is comprised of three subtests (Vocabulary, Similarities and Information) and is a measure of verbal comprehension and general information. Perceptual Reasoning is also comprised of three subtests (Block Design, Visual Puzzles, and Matrix Reasoning) and is a measure   
of visuoconstruction, visuospatial planning and visual reasoning. Working Memory is comprised of two   
subtests (Digit Span, Arithmetic or Letter\-Number Sequencing) and is a measure of the ability to briefly hold and manipulate material presented verbally. Processing Speed is comprised of two subtests a timed symbol cancellation and a symbol matching task (Coding and Symbol Search).

Attention: 

Models of attention vary and the most widely agreed\-upon model consists of two factors: deployment (arousal, focused, and sustained attention) and capacity/encoding (span of attention, resistance to interference, mental manipulation). In terms of deployment: arousal is usually evaluated by direct observation; sustained attention is usually assessed by continuous attention tasks (Ruff 2 & 

7, Numbers trial); and resistance to interference can be assessed by introducing interfering tasks (Ruff 2 & 7, Letters trial). 

**Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test:** assesses sustained attention through Numbers trial, a continuous attention task where respondent is asked to "cancel" the digits 2 and 7 in a field of other numbers; and assesses resistance to interference with the Letters trial, where respondent is asked to "cancel" the digits 2 and 7 in a field of letters.

**Word fluency tests** can be used to distinguish brain\-injured adults from normal controls. 

Semantic fluency: is evaluated by asking the respondent to name as many kinds of animals, fruits, vegetables, colors, etc., in a specific period of time (60"). Semantic or category fluency tests are thought to be the easiest of these tests because they do not require the educational level or vocabulary of phonemic fluency tests. 

Phonemic fluency (*Controlled Oral Word Association Test)*: is evaluated by asking the respondent to list as many words as they can, excluding proper nouns, beginning with a specific consonant. (There are three trials: 'c', then 'f' and then '1'.)

Learning and Memory:   
**Logical Memory:** assesses memory for two short stories consisting of 25 details each \[50 points possible\]. There is an immediate recall condition, and a delayed recall condition after a 25\-minute delay. There is also a recognition condition (yes/no questions about the stories) consisting of 8 items for the first story and 15 items for the second story \[23 total score possible\].   
.   
**Visual Reproduction: assesses** the individual's immediate and delayed recall, and recognition memory for five designs. Each design is revealed for 10 seconds, after which the respondent is asked to **immediately draw** the design from memory. After a 15\-minute delay, the respondent is asked **again** to **draw the** designs from memory, and then select the designs on a forced\-choice task (from 6 designs). 

**California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition**: assesses memory for a list of 16 items in the following **states**: immediate memory across 5 trials; short\-delay free and cued recall; long\-delay free and cued recall; and recognition memory.

Emotional/Psychological Function:   
**Patient Health Questionnaire** \- 9 (PHQ\-9): is a 9\-question instrument given to patients in a health care setting to screen for the presence and severity of depression.   
He endorsed *feeling down and depressed, feeling bad about himself and being fidgety and restless* "nearly every day" along with *problems with sleep*, *poor appetite, and thoughts that he would be better off dead* "more than half the days \[over the past 2 weeks}. These problems make it "very difficult" to do work, take care of things at home or get along with other people. His total score was in the range of a **moderately severe depressive disorder**. 

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder**\-7 **(GAD**\-7): Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 is a self\-reported questionnaire for screening and severity measuring of generalized anxiety disorder. GAD\-7 has seven items, which measure severity of various signs of GAD according to reported response categories with assigned points. The GAD\-7 items include: 1) nervousness; 2) inability to stop worrying; 3) excessive worry; 4) restlessness; 5) difficulty in relaxing; 6) easy irritation; and 7 fear of something awful happening. 

He indicated feeling anxious or on edge, constantly worrying, trouble relaxing and becoming easily irritated or annoyed "nearly every day" along with restlessness "nearly every day" \[over the past two weeks\]. His score fell into the range of a **severe anxiety disorder**. 

Social Functioning: 

**Advanced Clinical Solutions \- Social Cognition**: Affect Naming subtest assesses an individual's ability to understand non\-verbal communication and social interactions. 

**Social Perception:** designed to measure processes thought to be involved in social interactions and communications. It is comprised of three item sets that measure different components of social perception, one of which is **Affect Naming**. In Affect Naming, the examinee sees six Faces expressions to which is attributed one of seven possible emotions: happy, sad, angry, disgust, fear, surprise, or neutral.

**Social Responsiveness Scale \- 2 (SRS\-2):** a 65\-item, 4\-point Likert scale, objective measure of symptoms associated with autism. It consists of five subscales: Social Awareness (Awr. \- ability to pick up on social cues), Social Cognition (Cog. \- ability to interpret social cues once they are picked up), Social Communication (Com. \- expressive social communication), Social Motivation (Mot. \- motivation to engage in social\-interpersonal behavior) and Restricted interests and Repetitive Behavior (RRB- highly restricted interests or stereotypical behaviors). There are two additional scores, Social Communication Index (excludes RRB score) and Total Score Results. Based on extensive norming and data analysis, an SRS\-2 Total Score value of T \>/\= 60 is recommended for screening any autism spectrum condition.

**DISCUSSION:** 

Mr. Balch's intellectual abilities for both verbal and visual processing scored in the high average range and above. His information base and vocabulary were both very advanced, commensurate with his college education. His ability to solve visuo\-spatial problems was also highly developed. 

Attention/Deficit\-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): Subjectively, Mr. Balch was impulsive throughout the evaluation process. For example, on Matrix Reasoning he simply pointed to a response without considering the choices, which lowered his score. He also had difficulty maintaining focus. For example, on Digit Span, he could repeat, reorder and sequence the first item (of a pair of items that had the same number of digits), but it was his pattern to lose focus and he consistently missed the second item. His scores on the Ruff, a specific test of attention showed that his pattern is to work very quickly (82nd %tile) but make a lot of mistakes (Accuracy \= 5th \- 6th %tile). When he was forced to sequence, Trail 1-4, he was able to work quickly up to the point where he was required to shift between numbers and letters where he lost focus and made a sequencing error. On the Brown questionnaire, his response pattern indicated "very significant problems with attention. Considering both the subjective and objective testing findings, he meets diagnostic criteria for an attentional disorder, combining both inattention and impulsivity. 

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects many areas of social communication, behavior and adjustment, and physical well\-being. It is often seen in multiple family members although no specific genetic link has yet been found. From the descriptions of Mr. Balch and his mother, his father has many features similar to someone with ASD and Mr. Balch's brother was   
diagnosed with autism in childhood. Socially, Mr. Balch was always different than his peers, which he attributed to looking Asian, although his mother commented "it was more than that". He avoided peers and had difficulty making friends starting in elementary school, eventually finding a few people who "were okay with \[him\]". He struggles with anxiety and depression and has developed an extra layer of social deficit due to the bullying he experienced in childhood and related trauma triggers, which further inhibit his ability to process the emotions and motives of others. Mr. Balch also has struggled with textural aversions and obsessiveness about food restrictions and diets, to the point that he has made himself ill, and he has other obsessions that have been present since he was little, indicative of the hyperfocus that is characteristic for someone with autism. 70% of individuals with ASD have problems with their gut, particularly in childhood, at least one\-third have a sleep disorder, and they are also **at** higher risk to develop allergies and asthmatic conditions, all of which Mr. Balch has or has experienced. 

Objectively, testing revealed that he had a great deal of difficulty differentiating emotions on faces, particularly negative from neutral emotions, scoring in a similar way to individuals with ASD. On the SRS, both he and Dorry rated his social skills as "extremely deficient", also within the range of someone on the autism spectrum. There is also a significant overlap between ASD and attentional disorder, another neurodevelopmental condition. In summary, from behavioral, social and physical indications, Mr. Balch appears to meet criteria for ASD. His memory scores were very low, which seemed to be related to difficulty retaining focus on the stories and word list, but it could be that there is an auditory processing delay related to his autism, as well. 

In summary, Mr. Balch is a highly intelligent man whose deficits make it difficult for him to interpret social interactions and communication. He has had problems maintaining employment in part due to misunderstandings about his expectations for the work or about how coworkers are treating him. To his credit, he persisted in his education to the point where he completed a bachelor's degree. It seems entirely within his grasp that he will be able to shift his studies to anthropology, an area about which he had interest since childhood. However, he would benefit from supports and accommodations for which he is eligible under his multiple diagnoses. 

**RECOMMENDATIONS:** 

Discuss the results of evaluation with your primary care provider. Mr. Balch would be eligible for a trial of medication to treat his ADHD but did not seem interested in exploring that option at this time. 

Continue psychotherapy. Mr. Abernathy's notes indicate that Mr. Balch has been making progress on his goals, including reduction in anxiety and depression, and increased ability to use relaxation to manage his mood. 

Continue Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). There is research evidence that EMDR can enable people to heal from the symptoms and emotional distress that are the result of disturbing life events. He is receiving this therapy from Jeanine Cordova, PhD, a colleague in Mr. Abernathy's practice. 

Accommodations for School: 

Due to his disabilities, Mr. Balch is eligible for accommodations at school. These include but are not limited to additional contact time with teachers to be sure he understands assignments and to prepare for tests; extended time to complete quizzes and examinations; testing in separate, quiet environment; flexible and extended deadlines to submit work, and study materials in most appropriate form (i.e., recordings; written rather than being given verbally). 

Autism services: 

There are resources available for people with autism through Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation, 228 W. Lincoln Highway 301, Schererville, IN 46375\. In the past, they have 

provided a free iPad for people diagnosed with autism and have a variety of services on their website (www.myasdf.org). 

The University of New Mexico, Center for Development and Disability, is a center of excellence for autism spectrum disorder. They have some services available, including a resource library and social groups. They are located at 2300 Menaul NE, Albuquerque, NM, 87107. 

The books *Improve Your Social Skills* (Wendler, 2020) and *NeuroTribes:* The *Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity* (Silberman, 2015) are both excellent resources. 

*Nerdy, shy and Socially Inappropriate: A User Guide to an Asperger* Life, Kim; good 

presentation of everyday problems.
