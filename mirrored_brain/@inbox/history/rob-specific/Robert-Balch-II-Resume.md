### **Professional Experience**

**Anchor Context Engine (ECE Core) | Lead Systems Architect**
*Albuquerque, NM | June 2025 – Present*
*Architected and engineered a high-security, local-first data retrieval engine designed to manage massive semantic context without external cloud dependencies.*
* **Enterprise Database Migration:** Led "Operation Titan," successfully migrating the system’s core persistence layer from embedded RocksDB to an enterprise-grade **PostgreSQL** architecture to ensure scalability and universal SQL compatibility.
* **Complex System Integration:** Orchestrated the "Iron Lung" hybrid architecture, bridging Node.js services with high-performance C++ native modules to offload critical processing, resulting in a **2.3x throughput increase**.
* **Automation & Workflow Engineering:** Developed robust "Watchdog" automation scripts to monitor filesystem changes and trigger secure ingestion pipelines, ensuring real-time data consistency across distributed nodes.
* **Security & Compliance:** Designed the system to operate effectively in air-gapped environments, ensuring 100% data sovereignty and eliminating hallucinated connections in sensitive compliance workflows.

**Tando Institute | Full Stack Developer**
*Remote | June 2025*
* **Critical Infrastructure Repair:** Restored 100% data discoverability during a site-wide outage by diagnosing a search index failure and deploying a custom Relevanssi engine, preventing extended downtime for the organization.
* **System Reliability:** Conducted root-cause analysis on legacy search failures and implemented automated indexing repairs.

**Dash 2 Labs | AI Engineer**
*Remote | March 2025 – June 2025*
* **Generative UI Engineering:** Engineered a "Chat-to-Chart" interface using Gemini LLM and LangChain, enabling non-technical users to query and visualize complex datasets through natural language commands.
* **User Experience Optimization:** Streamlined data interaction workflows, reducing the technical barrier to entry for complex data analysis tools.

**Petroleum Research and Recovery Center (PRRC) | Data Engineer**
*Socorro, NM | October 2024 – December 2024*
* **High-Volume ETL Pipelines:** Architected parallelized data pipelines using Dask and Obspy to ingest raw sensor streams, accelerating seismic data processing speeds by **10x** for downstream machine learning models.
* **Scientific Data Management:** Collaborated with research scientists to optimize data formats for high-performance computing environments.

**Dry Ice LLC | Full Stack Developer**
*Albuquerque, NM | September 2023 – December 2023*
* **Internal Systems Modernization:** Developed a centralized CRM and workflow management system using Next.js to replace fragmented spreadsheet processes.
* **Efficiency Improvement:** Reduced lead tracking latency by an estimated **40%** through automated status updates and centralized reporting.
