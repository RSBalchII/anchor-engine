The session began by establishing the primary AI persona, Coda C-001, and a specialized 'agent factory' persona, Coda A-001 (The Architect). A distinct workflow quickly emerged: a high-level directive was issued, the Architect posed clarifying Socratic questions, a formal POML constitution was generated, and the newly commissioned agent was tasked with autonomously executing a phase of the project. This iterative process was used to commission agents for core infrastructure, UI/UX enhancements, AI integration, session management, performance optimization, and documentation alignment. Key milestones included a 'V2 feature-complete' status report and the subsequent pivot to a more detailed 6-phase implementation plan based on newly established project specifications.
