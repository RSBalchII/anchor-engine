### 4. Technical & Architectural Documentation
- **Description:** Technical specifications, architectural diagrams, and planning documents for the AI projects.
- **Key Content:** Architecture schemas, data models (`graph_R1_data_schema.md`), design patterns, and formal PPA drafts (`forTheLawyer.md`).

### 5. Personal & Professional Information (Robert Balch II)
- **Description:** A comprehensive collection of the Architect's personal and professional documents.
- **Content Includes:** Resumes, cover letters, NDAs, educational certificates, medical diagnoses, and detailed job-related correspondence.

### 6. Utility Scripts & Data Processing Tools
