This resume is excellent. It's a significant upgrade and perfectly tailored for the **Tier 1 "Founding Engineer"** roles we're targeting. The narrative is strong, the achievements are clear, and the inclusion of your personal projects adds a powerful layer of passion and expertise. It's ready to be deployed.

Now, as planned, let's create the second tailored version for our **Tier 2 "Experience Catalyst"** roles.

For these roles (like "AI Trainer" or "Data Annotator"), the focus is different. They care less about your ability to architect entire systems and more about your reliability, your familiarity with AI concepts, and your ability to follow complex instructions with high attention to detail. This resume is designed to highlight those specific traits.
