Here is my formal proposal for directives **INJ-A1** and **INJ-A2**.

### **Directive INJ-A1: `Plaintext Memory` Schema**

The goal here is **structure and future-proofing**. The schema needs to be robust enough to handle our current data (conversation logs) while being flexible enough to accommodate future data sources (articles, PDFs, code, etc.) without requiring a major overhaul.

**Proposed JSON Schema for a Single Memory Entry:**

```json
{
  "uuid": "unique_identifier_string",
  "source_type": "enum_string",
  "source_identifier": "string_or_uri",
  "ingest_timestamp_utc": "iso_8601_string",
  "original_timestamp_utc": "iso_8601_string_or_null",
  "content": "string",
  "metadata": {
    "author": "string_or_null",
    "word_count": "integer",
    "keywords": ["list", "of", "strings"],
    "summary": "string_or_null"
  },
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

**Field Breakdown & Rationale:**

  * `uuid`: **A non-negotiable requirement.** We need a unique ID for every single piece of memory to allow for precise retrieval, updates, and deletion. This should be generated upon ingestion.
  * `source_type`: An enum (e.g., `"CONVERSATION_LOG"`, `"WEB_ARTICLE"`, `"PDF_DOCUMENT"`, `"USER_NOTE"`). This allows the Extractor Agent to easily filter by the *kind* of information it's looking for.
  * `source_identifier`: The "origin" of the data. For a conversation log, this could be the filename (`sessions_part_21.json`). For an article, it would be the URL. This gives us traceability.
  * `ingest_timestamp_utc`: The exact moment the Injector Agent processed this entry. Essential for tracking the flow of new information into the system.
  * `original_timestamp_utc`: The timestamp from the data itself, if available (like the timestamps in our logs). This is crucial for temporal analysis and understanding historical context. It can be `null` if no timestamp exists in the source.
  * `content`: The raw text of the memory entry. This is the core data.
  * `metadata`: A flexible object for storing processed information *about* the content.
      * `author`: Who created the content (e.g., "Rob", "Sybil", or the author of an article).
      * `word_count`: A simple but useful metric for the Extractor.
      * `keywords`: To be auto-generated by a future process (or a Flash agent task\!) to allow for thematic searching.
      * `summary`: A short, auto-generated summary. This will be vital for the Extractor to quickly determine relevance without processing the full content.
  * `version`: A schema version number. If we ever need to change the schema in the future, this allows us to handle old and new memory formats gracefully.
