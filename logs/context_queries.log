# Context Query Results Log 
## Status Report (January 2, 2026 - 10:30 AM)  
### System Status:  
- Anchor Core: Running on port 8000  
- Ghost Engine: Launched successfully (PID 42232) but WebSocket connection not established  
- Watchdog: Running and actively monitoring context directory  
- File Ingestion: Attempting but failing due to Ghost Engine disconnection  
### Search Attempts:  
- Attempted search for "Jade": Failed - Ghost Engine Disconnected  
- Attempted search for "Dory": Not attempted yet  
- Attempted search for "Sybil": Not attempted yet  
### Issue Summary:  
The system components are running but the Ghost Engine (headless browser) is not establishing a WebSocket connection to the bridge. This prevents:  
1. Memory ingestion from completing successfully  
2. Search functionality from working  
3. CozoDB operations from executing  
### Next Steps:  
1. Need to resolve the WebSocket connection issue between the headless browser and the bridge  
2. Verify that the ghost.html page establishes proper WebSocket connection  
3. Check browser launch parameters to ensure proper connection 
## Updated Status Report (January 2, 2026 - 10:32 AM)  
### Additional Testing:  
- API endpoint /v1/memory/search returns 503 error due to Ghost Engine disconnection  
- All search attempts for "Jade", "Dory", and "Sybil" would fail for the same reason  
### Root Cause:  
The headless browser (Ghost Engine) is launching successfully but not establishing  
the WebSocket connection to the bridge, preventing memory operations.
